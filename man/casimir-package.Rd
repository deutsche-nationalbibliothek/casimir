\title{casimir: Comparing Automated Subject Indexing Methods in R}
\description{
This package contains functions for evaluating automatic subject indexing results. The main focus of the package is to enable efficient computation of set retrieval and ranked retrieval metrics across multiple dimensions of a dataset, e.g. document strata or subsets of the label-set. The package also provides the possibility of computing boot-strap confidence intervals for all major metrics, with seemless integration for parallel computation and propensity scored variants of standard metrics.
